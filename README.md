# cpp-vector-oop-project
This project consists of 2 different parts. First part is related to memory management and the second part focuses on OOP. 
<h2>A report on the factors affecting the number of clocks in part 1.3 of the project based on my observation:</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The number of the inserted/removed shape objects:<br>                                                                                 The more shape objects, the more          The more shape objects, the more clocks will be needed.</li>
  <li>The amount of memory allocated to the data member of the shape class:<br>
      As the amount of memory increases, the number of clocks will also increase.</li>
  <li>The number of existing elements before inserting/removing elements:<br>
      This factor and the number of clocks have a direct relationship as well.</li>
  <li>D.	After a lot of examination, inserting needs more clocks than removing at most of the times, because of a simpler function.  </li>
</ul>
