<h1>part2:</h1>
<p> In this part of the project, i was trying to model a realistic car through an approximate simulation for few parts of it, using inheritance, polymorphism and composition.</p>
<p>As you can see, there are simple parts such as a fuel filter and a trunk (if the car is not a hatchback one!) beside 
a complex part like gearbox consisting of the gear and the input shaft. <p>
<p>as you run the program you can see the total mass, volume and surface of either a sedan or hatchback car.</p>
